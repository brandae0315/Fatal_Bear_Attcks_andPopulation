# Fatal Bear Attacks 2000–2025

## Project Overview
This project visualizes fatal bear attacks in North America between 2000–2025, alongside state-level bear population data. The interactive web map provides insights into the geographic distribution of incidents and highlights correlations with bear populations across states.

## Features
- **Interactive Map**: Built with Leaflet, allowing users to explore attack locations and bear population densities.
- **Custom Icons**: Distinguish between Brown, Black, and Polar bear incidents using Font Awesome paw markers.
- **Choropleth Layer**: Displays bear population per state with graduated color scales for easy comparison.
- **Popups & Legend**: Clickable states reveal bear population counts; legend clarifies symbology.

## Libraries Used
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for mapping
- [Leaflet-AJAX](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/leaflet-ajax) for GeoJSON integration
- [Chroma.js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) for color scales
